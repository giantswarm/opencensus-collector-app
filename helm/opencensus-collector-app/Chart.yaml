  The OpenCensus Collector is a component that runs "nearby" (e.g. in the same VPC, AZ, etc.)
  a userâ€™s application components and receives trace spans and metrics emitted by supported Receivers.
  The received spans and metrics could be emitted directly by clients in instrumented tasks, or
  potentially routed via intermediate proxy sidecar/daemon agents such as the OpenCensus Agent.
  The collector provides a central egress point for exporting traces and metrics to one or more tracing
  and/or metrics backends while offering buffering and retries as well as advanced aggregation, filtering,
  annotation and intelligent sampling capabilities.
